Dear Sir,

I have a problem with Your MIME-Parser-1.9
and multipart-nested messages. 
Not all parts are parsed.

Here my Makefile, Your own multipart-nested.msg
and its out after "make test".
Some my messages not completely parsed too. 

Is this a bug?

Thank You for help.


Igor Starovoytov.
