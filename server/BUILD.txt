######################################################

The primary build tool for James server is maven 3 (3.0.2 is required).

On a new source checkout from https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/james/ start by running
$ mvn clean package

This will compiled all modules and build the distribution.
The distribution binary and source build can be found under "container-spring/target" 
and should contain everything you need to start with.

For just building without running junit tests:
$ mvn clean package -DskipTests=true
