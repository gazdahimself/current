    <section name="Postage standard mail headers">
      <p>To recognize its own mails, Postage adds a couple of headers to its test mails. AbstractMailFactory takes care for adding those headers correctly.</p>
      <p><code>X-James-Postage=This is a test mail sent by James Postage</code></p>
      <p><code>X-James-Postage-Count=1158086107828-1</code> where "1158086107828" is constant for the whole scenario run while "1" is incremented with every test mail.</p>
      <p><code>X-James-Postage-Count=PROFORMA</code> is used for all mails in the startup phase.</p>
      <p><code>Message-ID=Postage-1158086175218</code> where "1158086175218" is a time stamp distinguishing this mail from all others.</p>
      <p><code>X-James-Validator=org.apache.james.postage.mail.AbstractMailFactory</code></p>
      <p>These headers are used for identifying, matching and validating test mails. If headers are missing, the result report can not be build properly.</p>
