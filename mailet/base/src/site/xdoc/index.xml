    <section name="Basic Mailet Toolkit">
      	<p>
A toolkit for builders of mailets and matchers with minimal dependencies.
		</p>
<p><a href='http://james.apache.org/mailet/base'>Apache James Mailets Base</a> 
collects a number of utilites and lightweight frameworks useful when working 
with the <a href='http://james.apache.org/mailet'>Apache Mailet API</a> (a framework
assisting the rapid development of email processing functionality). 
Mailets base is used as the basis for the email processing functions shipped 
with the <a href='http://james.apache.org/server'>Apache James</a> server 
but is not dependent on that server.</p>
        <subsection name='Releases'>
          <p>
          Apache Mailet Base 1.0 is available to 
          <a href='http://james.apache.org/download.cgi#Apache%20Mailet%20Base'>download</a>. This is the first
          independent release of this code base which was previously shipped as part of 
          <a href='http://james.apache.org/server'>Apache James Server</a>. It should therefore be considered 
          mature.
