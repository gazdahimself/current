        <section name="Java DKIM Library">
		<p>This is a DKIM implementation library written in Java.</p>
		<p>The architecture is interface based and pluggable. You can tweak it almost in every behaviour.</p>
		<p>The architecture is thought to handle multiple signatures with performance in mind: body hashing
for multiple signatures is computed concurrently in a single stream run.
		</p>
		<p>The whole internal verification/signing is dove via OutputStream leaving much more flexibility than
the use of InputStream. As the InputStream approach is easier from the user side the default
implementation simply prepare the OutputStream and copy the supplied InputStream to the OutputStream.</p>

<p>In order to reduce depencencies and to not reinvent the wheel the resulting library includes a
"shaded" version of the commons-codec 1.4 classes needed to do Base64 encoding/decoding.</p>
