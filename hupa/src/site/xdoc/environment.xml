            <p>
                Great! Hupa is a new project, which just made it from the labs over to
                the james
                project.
                We have a solid codebase, but there are many features
                missing. But you already
                know that, right?
                At least that is why you are
                trying to help, correct?
            </p>
            <p>
                So, what do you need... We develop in eclipse, hence this document
                describes
                how to setup eclipse,
                to get a Hupa Development Environment up
                and running. So if you are a
                developer who is using netbeans
                or any other
                IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, don't hesitate, to tell us how you setup
                your
                Environment, and
                we will be more than happy to include the documentation
                as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                This document describes which steps are needed to setup eclipse, as if
                it was
                freshly downloaded.
                So if you already have some plugins installed,
                skip over to the next section.
                Other than that,
                all that is left for is to
                wish you guys fun coding Hupa!

        <section name="How to setup eclipse...">
            <subsection name="What Version do you need">
                <p>
                    Eclipse can be downloaded from
                    <a href="http://download.eclipse.org">the eclipse download page</a>
                    I recommend using the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers or the Eclipse
                    IDE for Java EE Developers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you need help installing eclipse, you can find the answers you are
                    looking for on the
                    <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_Where_do_I_get_and_install_Eclipse%3F">eclipse homepage</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    From this point on we assume you have a running distribution of
                    eclipse installed on your system.

            <subsection name="Setting up the maven eclipse plugin">
                <p>
                    Hupa uses maven2 as its build tool. Although it is possible to only
                    run maven commands
                    from the command line, a tight integration into the
                    tool you use to write and run the code is a lot nicer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nowadays there is more than one plugin for eclipse to interact with
                    maven2. Although all might be great, I only know my way around the
                    m2eclipse plugin. I work
                    with it on all my m2 projects, and it provides
                    me with the tools I need to get
                    the job done. Again, if you provide the
                    documentation for other
                    plugins, we would be more than happy to put
                    them up here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But enough of the bla bla let us get started. You can download the
                    plugin
                    <a href="http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/">here.</a>
                    The Installation Instructions are right on the first page. From this
                    point this guide assumes that you have the m2eclipse plugin installed.
                </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Setting up the GWT Plugin">
                <p>
                    Hupa is developed using
                    <a href="http://code.google.com/intl/de/webtoolkit/">GWT</a>
                    So to make your development a lot easier we recommend installing the
                    <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/tools/eclipse.html">google plugin for eclipse</a>
                </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Setting up subclipse">
                <p>
                    The ASF uses subversion as its Version Control System (VCS). So to be
                    able to check out the source code I recommend using a special plugin
                    called
                    <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/">subclipse</a>
                    After subclipse is installed, it is fairly easy to start your
                    development on Hupa :)
                </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Checking out the Hupa source code">
                <p>
                    Now we have everything setup to be able to check out and run the Hupa
                    source code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Open up Eclipse and go to Window -> Open Perspective -> Other -> SVN
                    Repository Exploring
                    <br />
                    <img src="images/dev/svn-repo.jpg" />
                    <br />
                    In the SVN Repositories View Click the right mouse button and choose
                    New -> Repository Location ...
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the Dialog enter the following url in the URL Field:
                    http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf then click on Finish. After that the
                    ASF Software Repository should be visible inside your SVN Repositories
                    view as shown here.
                    <br />
                    <img src="images/dev/svn-repositories-installed.jpg" />
                    <br />
                </p>
                <p>
                    Expand the Repository, then james, then hupa, and finally do a right
                    click on trunk and select Checkout. Fill in the settings as you think
                    they fit your needs.
                    <br />
                    <img src="images/dev/checkout-hupa.jpg" />
                    <br />
                </p>
                <p>
                    So after everything is set up correctly your screen should look like
                    this one here.
                    <br />
                    <img src="images/dev/eclipse_setup.jpg" />
                    <br />
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, that the foundation is laid out, we can finally
                    <a href="building.html">build hupa</a>
                    .
