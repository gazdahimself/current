		<section name="What is Hupa?">
			<p> Hupa is an Rich IMAP-based Webmail application written in GWT
				(Google Web Toolkit).          </p>
			<p> Hupa has been entirely written in java to be coherent with the
				language used in the James project. And It has been a reference of a
				devloping using GWT good practices (MVP pattern and Unit testing) </p>
			<p> Hupa is a functional and well designed email client, ready for
				reading, sending and managing messages, but it still lacks of many features
				email clients nowadays have.</p>

        <section name="Demo">
            <p> There are <a href='http://james.zones.apache.org/index.html'>two</a> instances of Hupa running in the ASF infra. One is
                configured to use GMail IMAP and SMTP servers, so any gmail account
                should work. The other one uses a set of messages used to test Hupa
                with fake imap and smtp servers implementations.
